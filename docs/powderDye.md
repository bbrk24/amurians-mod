# Powder Dyes

Powder dye, and its relative dye dust, are colored powder items. Powder dye can be obtained by
trading, or by combining dye dust; dye dust can be obtained by breaking down powder dye or by
smelting regular dye. Cyan powder dye specifically can be obtained by smelting hishai fruit.

The powder dye can be used like regular dye to dye shulker boxes and pets' collars; it replaces
vanilla dye in firework star recipes.
